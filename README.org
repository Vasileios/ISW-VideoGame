* Using wearable controller for navigation and interaction in videogames.
In this project the LiveGloving wearable system (glove) (Agiomyrgianakis, 2021)
has been used to control the movement of the character in the videogame
environment, as well as to activate events such as sounds, to be able to
interrupt the recording, to emit light bulbs, to pause the game, and to display
the options menu. For this project I have adapted the glove for the needs of the
game. This means that I have used the data from the 3-axis accelerometer sensor
to control the movement of the character into the environment and the buttons to
activate and deactivate events.

In UE4 I have built the algorithm that is responsible to receive data from the sensors and to translate them into a movement mechanism, and other actions of the player. To succeed the communication between the glove and UE4-SuperCollider, I have made use of the OSC communication protocol.
UE4 has a plethora of libraries (plug-ins) such as OSC. To enable OSC plugin in UE4 it is necessary to navigate to Edit > Plugins > Input Devices, and to check the OSC enable option. This plugin “provides an
intuitive, type-safe Blueprint library that a developer can use to quickly
iterate networked audio (and potentially other domain) data in Unreal Engine.
When this plugin is enabled, you can send and receive OSC events through a
simple API in either C++ or Blueprint. It supports sending and receiving
messages and bundles, or combinations of bundles and messages.

* Algorithmic composition paradigms in SuperCollider environment

In SuperCollider there are built-in tools for ambisonics as well as extensions such as the ATK ambisonics tool kit by Joseph Anderson (2012)’. The ATK library has been developed for SuperCollider3 in 2012. In this project I have experimented with some paradigms using the built-in tools such as the PanB which is an Ambisonic B format panner with output channels in order W, X, Y, Z, and ATK library such as FoaDecoderMatrix.newStereo and FoaDecoderKernel.newUHJ which are two channel stereo, and two channels binaural.

Figure 1 shows the algorithm for OSC communication between UE4 and other programming environments such as SuperCollider.
